# Pseudocode
stack data structure: last in first out
so if we have this string (] which it should return FALSE
we basically need to do things:
    - push when we open a parenthesis 
    - pop when we have closing parenthesis
but we will have a little problem which is going to be the type of parenthesis explain:
    if we have three types of parenthesis
    ()
    []
    {}
    and we have type 1. ( open and push into our stack
    we want to make sure we pop when we get closing tag of the same type 1. )
    but if we have closing parenthesis from type 2 we need to ] check
        check if the parenthesis type 2 is in the stack
        if not return is false
